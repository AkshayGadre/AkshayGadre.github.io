  <ul>
    <li>Performed research on software-defined network superoptimizers and proposed a new approach to centralized routing as a constraint satisfaction problem, which scaled to topologies as large as 8-pod fat trees.</li>
    <li>Working with physical OpenStack cluster and OpenFlow switches to derive proof of concept of the planned algorithm.</li>
    <li>Developing a robust tool to integrate the above algorithm into modern systems using OpenFloodlight and OpenStack.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Studied state-of-the-art Machine Translation(MT) system evaluation metrics and developed a procedure to compare the performances of MT systems on code-mixed texts.</li>
    <li>Developed features to tackle the problem of code-switching in Named Entity Recognition by making it language independent, and unsupervised.</li>
    <li>Confirmed the usefulness of the above features in segregating named entities from other words and the dire need of new algorithms for machine translation of code-mixed text.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Performed research in the area of game-based assessment of behavioral characteristics and nudging person\'s choices through gamification of real-life situation</li>
    <li>Developed a web-based game for the project manager\'s behavior in the real-life and to extract valuable emotional and behavioral data to predict real life behavior. (Based on Computer Science and Psychology)</li>
