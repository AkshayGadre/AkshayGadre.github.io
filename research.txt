  <div>	We build the next-generation of <span class="sp1">wireless, mobile and cyber-physical systems</span>. The goal of our research at <a class="sp1" href="https://newtlab.ece.uw.edu/">Networking and Emerging Wireless Technologies (NEWT) Lab</a> is to develop new communication and sensing capabilities for the next-generation of wireless technologies. My doctoral work developed novel wireless physical layer solutions and phase-synchronization architectures for city-wide low-power wide area network infrastructure to improve the range, battery life and throughput of these power-starved IoT clients, further enabling important applications at scale such as forest fire detection and real-time satellite monitoring. The current active research areas are described below:
