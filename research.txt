  <div>	My research primarily focuses on improving the connectivity, sensing capability and security of wireless clients in the city-scale Internet-of-Things(IoT) ecosystem. Specifically, my projects attempt to improve the range, battery life and throughput of wireless clients to enable city-scale IoT subsystems, utilize the ubiquitous infrastructure for enabling novel applications and secure these low-power heterogeneous devices.

      <p class="leftalign smallText">Low-Power Wide Area Network(LP-WAN) devices are pushing the boundaries of long range low-cost battery powered communications. Today, a LP-WAN transceiver boasts of a 10-year battery life on an AA battery at a very small bandwidth across kilometers. These capabilities enable lot of new city-scale/long-range applications, like city-scale package tracking, tracking lost wallets across parks. However, the benefits also bring a set of new exciting challenges, related to the low-cost, low power consumption and small bandwidth. <span class="sp1">Can we enhance the capabilities of these LP-WAN devices with minimal overheads and provide city-scale services? My research on improving connectivity for LP-WAN devices attempts to answer that question.</span> </p>

Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway. Through a novel hardware and software design at the gateway, Charm carefully detects which chunks of the received signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We present a scalable solution to decoding weak transmissions at city-scale by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charm demonstrates a gain of up to 3x in range and 4x in client battery-life.</p>		</p>
        <p><img class="ProjImage" src="Chime.jpg" alt="Chime" style="margin-right:15px;"> <p><span class="sp1 underliner"><a href="https://www.witechlab.com/chime.html">Chime: Frequency Configuration for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks in a Heartbeat</a></span></p>		<p class="smallText">The low bandwidth of LP-WANs means that there are hundreds of operating frequencies to choose from, with received signal power varying rapidly with frequency of client transmission. Chime is a system enabling LP-WAN base stations to identify an optimal frequency of operation after the client sends one packet at one frequency. Chime achieves this by analyzing the wireless channels of this packet across many base stations to disentangle multipath and ascertain an optimal frequency that maximizes client battery life and minimizes interference. We implement Chime on a campus-scale test-bed and achieve a median gain of 3.4 dB in SINR leading to a median increase in battery life of 230% (~1.4-5.7 years), data rate by 3.3x  and reduction in interference of 2.8x over commodity LP-WANs.</p></p>

      <p class="leftalign smallText">Internet of Things(IoT) is penetrating all walks of life, from cars, to industrial equipment to even implanted pacemakers. It is estimated that the number of IoT devices will exceed 75 billion by 2020. Most of these devices being low-power and cheap remain vulnerable to various threats from malicious intruders.
    <span class="sp1">Can we secure these billions of heterogeneous devices with minimal power and compute consumption and yet remain secure against much more powerful adversaries? My research on IoT authentication attempts to develop novel communication mechanisms to solve this problem.</span></p>
