  <div>	My research is at the intersection of wireless, mobile and cyber-physical systems. The goal of my research is to <span class="sp1">empower the low-power Internet-of-Things(IoT) sensors deployed on earth and space by enabling better connectivity, sensing capability and scalability</span>. My current work has developed novel wireless physical layer solutions that  co-optimize higher layer network and application objectives of the city-wide low-power wide area network infrastructure with the client throughput. This approach improves the range, battery life and throughput of IoT clients and reduces latency for data-driven inference applications at scale such as forest fire detection and real-time satellite monitoring. My work has been published at premier cyber-physical systems and mobile systems venues like IPSN, NSDI,  MobiCom,  and  ICC. My papers have received the Best Paper Awards at IPSN 2018 and IPSN 2020. My talk was awarded the Best Presentation Award at the IPSN PhD Forum 2020. I have also received the ACM SIGBED-SIGSOFT Frank Anger Memorial Award 2021 for my cross-disciplinary research across embedded systems and software engineering. My work on IoT security and privacy was recognized with the CyLab Presidential Fellowship 2020-21.
    <p>My research focuses on improving the capabilities of IoT wireless technologies for smart cities and satellite connectivity.  IoT deployments are inherently asymmetric where more resourceful base stations and cloud infrastructure lie on the other side of a IoT clients' bandwidth starved link. This precludes the possibility of data-driven applications on IoT deployments for large scale sensing such as smart agriculture, automated traffic signals and micro-climate monitoring. While some smart-home sensors can communicate large amounts of data to enable low-latency complex inference applications, the big data revolution has eluded low-power IoT sensors from realizing their true potential.</p>

    <p>My research overcomes fundamental limitations of IoT wireless technologies and builds systems that enable such data driven applications at scale. Firstly, we develop solutions that can push the wireless and compute operations from these low-power IoT clients to the much more powerful base stations. We further take a cross-layer approach to enable data-driven applications on these IoT sensors at scale by <span class="sp1">co-optimizing their wireless  physical layer to improve client range and throughput while reducing latency for higher level network and inference objectives</span>. My solutions apply these principles for improving low-power wide-area networks (LP-WANs), a class of low-power IoT technologies with 10 km range and 10 year battery lives but low throughput (~few kbps), where this asymmetry is particularly stark. My approach has pushed the capabilities of low-power IoT by: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="sp1">Improving client throughput and range:</span> We enable base station collaboration which allows us to push components of the physical layer from the clients to the base stations and the shared cloud infrastructure. This off-loading of the IoT client physical layer operations, e.g. frequency selection, can improve the range and throughput by 4X and triple client battery lives (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/chime.html">Chime</a>,<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/charm.html"> Charm</a>). This collaborative base station framework can also enable decameter-level location tracking (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/owll.html">OwLL</a>).
      <li><span class="sp1">Enabling inference on terrestrial deployments at scale:</span> We co-design the client physical layer with the inference models to optimize for inference quality within the constraints of client limits. Our solution <a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/quail.html">QuAiL</a> builds a distributed LP-WAN physical layer that can perform complex low-latency statistical, spatial and inference queries from thousands of clients. It can be extended to perform time-series analytics with reduction in energy cost (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/joltik.html">Joltik</a>).
      <li><span class="sp1">Enabling low-latency inference on LoRa-enabled CubeSats:</span> Another context where low-power clients face similar throughput bottlenecks are small satellites operating in low-earth orbit, popularly known as CubeSats. We show that by co-designing higher level data-driven applications within the limitations of the LoRa satellite-to-ground-station physical layer can lead to multi-fold improvement in inference quality (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/">Vista</a>).
    </ul>
    <p>My solutions were deployed and evaluated on a multi-base station testbed spanning the city of Pittsburgh. Further, my research on LoRa-enabled CubeSats was evaluated on traces from a LoRa-enabled CubeSat V-R3X launched in collaboration with NASA. Our research has built several artifacts that have been broadly adapted by the community -- large-scale measurement studies, open hardware platforms for base stations and clients, and open-source code and data for all our solutions. My research on low-power IoT has featured in the popular press - IEEE ComSoc Blog, 90.5 FM WESA, Washington Post. My ongoing work with Microsoft Azure Global has been filed for patent with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of dollars for sellers, customers and the supply chain companies. The work was demonstrated to and received exciting interest from top executives at Azure.</p>

    <p><span class="sp1">Improving low-power IoT client communication and base station collaboration</span></p>
      <p class="leftalign smallText">An important objective for any IoT deployment is to maximize the throughput and battery-life of the clients. Yet, maximizing the efficiency of low-power IoT clients leveraging existing infrastructure and limited spectrum would require collaboration and ability to co-optimize service for the growing number of wireless sensors. Such collaboration can only be possible with synchronization between the base stations, an efficient compute resource for optimization and a robust backhaul to connect the base stations to the compute resource. </p>
        <p>	<img class="ProjImage" src="Chime.jpg" alt="Chime" style="margin-right:25px;"> <p>My approach builds a synchronization framework for LoRa base stations that enables each of them to measure the phase of the same packet relative to a master base station. This unleashes the untapped potential of phase-based solutions for low-power IoT devices. Our evaluation on the multi-base station deployment demonstrates that these distributed phase measurements can be leveraged to enable automated radio configuration to improve throughput (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/chime.html">Chime</a>), perform coherent combining to quadruple the range (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/charm.html">Charm</a>) and accurately localize IoT clients upto a few meters (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/owll.html"> OwLL</a>).</p><p>The cloud is a perfect compute resource for LoRa especially due to LoRa's lax latency constraints and the cloud's elasticity. However, it requires distributed base stations to receive wireless signals and haul them to the cloud. Thus, we design a custom hardware-platform for the base station (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/charm.html">Charm</a>) that can data-efficiently stream the received wireless signals to the cloud and retrieve the response. Finally, to enable efficient wireless backhauls for remote base stations, we present a bidirectional mmWave full-duplex communication system that can lead to 1.67X improvement in throughput for links to the cloud (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/mmfd.html">mmFD</a>).</p>		</p>
  <p><span class="sp1">Enabling inference applications on terrestrial low-power IoT deployments</span></p>
  <p class="leftalign smallText">An important impediment to develop sensing and inference applications with increasing number of IoT clients is the ability to retrieve information from them.  Traditional approaches of information retrieval are either too latency intensive or do not scale when the number of clients becomes large (hundreds to thousands). Unlike prior work that focuses on individual client or developing data-efficient inference algorithms, my approach co-designs the wireless physical layer for information retrieval and inference simultaneously.  </p>
  <p>	<img class="ProjImage" src="QuAiL.jpg" alt="QuAiL" style="margin-right:25px;"> <p>A key observation that drives my approach is that performing an inference query on a large deployment only requires a small linear projection of the vast raw data. My solution <a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/quail.html">QuAiL</a> identifies when packets of all clients are transmitted simultaneously, their energies add up linearly at an average. Thus, we develop a distributed wireless physical layer than ensures robust, channel-aware collisions from thousands of clients. We show how this linear wireless layer can substitute the first layer of inference on popularly used statistical, spatial and machine learning inference queries. Our evaluation shows a latency of several milliseconds to retrieve information from tens of thousands of nodes, significantly better than the state-of-the-art.</p><p>Another important type of data analysis typically performed on measured values of these low-power IoT sensors are temporal analytics. Unfortunately, transmitting large swaths of time-series data over the bandwidth-bottlenecked links is infeasible. However, we make a key observation that most of these temporal statistics are simple functions of the frequency distribution of the sensed value. We leverage this insight and recent advances in universal sketching to build a constant size encoding to capture these distributions. Our evaluation shows that such energy-efficient aggregation over time reduces the power consumption  for temporal analytics from these low-power sensors by 24.7X (<a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/joltik.html">Joltik</a>).</p>		</p>
  <p><span class="sp1">Low-latency inference on LoRa-enabled CubeSats</span></p>
  <p class="leftalign smallText">The advent of small and cheap-to-deploy satellites, known as CubeSats, in the low-earth orbit is opening up new opportunities to study the behavior of satellite communication links and improve their capabilities. One key problem that most satellite deployments face is that of latency. Using proprietary technologies allows space companies to enable high downlink throughput at the cost of deploying costly specialized base stations sparsely. However, a recent trend, particularly adapted by new entrants in the CubeSat domain, is to use the existing long range communication infrastructure of LoRa for communicating with the satellites. </p>
  <p>	<img class="ProjImage" src="Vista.jpg" alt="Vista" style="margin-right:25px;"> <p>While the global prevalence of LoRa ground station infrastructure reduces the latency of downlink, it does so at a drastic cost of throughput. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that such low-power IoT technologies were not designed to communicate with fast moving CubeSats. While these satellites are still being improved, most of them communicate only paltry diagnostic data or location data every hour. We instead ask a simple question,``How do we design practical  LoRa-enabled CubeSats that can communicate with existing ground infrastructure for rich applications including satellite imagery?''</p><p> Our solution <a class="spBlue" href="https://www.witechlab.com/">Vista</a> achieves this by co-designing the wireless physical layer and the compression-based inference algorithms. Specifically, we leverage the existing knowledge of images, tasks and the wireless channels to encode the image information optimally. Our data-task-channel aware auto-encoder optimizes for inference output and also ensures resilience to wireless channel losses over the air. We also develop solutions at the ground infrastructure to enhance the Doppler resilience of the CubeSat packet. Our evaluation on real channel-traces retrieved from LoRa-enabled CubeSat V-R3X, show that Vista can provide an effective 4.56 dB improvement in image retrieval SNR and 1.38X improvement in classification tasks over the image.</p>		</p>
